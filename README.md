<h1>Linux Server Configuration Project</h1>
This is my submission for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree's Linux Server Configuration Project. The task was to take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host a web application. I secured the server from a number of attack vectors, installed and configured a database server, installed and configured a web server, and deployed an existing web applications onto it.
<h2>Server Details</h2>

<p>SSH Port: <code>2200</code></p>
<p>URL: http://www.35.183.106.36.nip.io/</p>
